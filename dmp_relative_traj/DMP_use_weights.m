function y = DMP_use_weights()
%% This function takes the learned weights of DMP, and generates a new trajectory given the new start, new goal and specified trajectory length.
% Actually, nonlinear force retrieval and motion retrieval have been
% implemented and tested in DMP_learn_weights.m, e.g. LWR, direct inverse,
% polynomial fitting, this function is only to provide an interface for
% generating new trajectory given new g, y0 and nbData!!!
