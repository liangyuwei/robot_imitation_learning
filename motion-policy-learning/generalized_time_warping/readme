Introduction 

This page contains software and instructions for generalized time
warping (GTW) [1]. In addition, we provide implementations of the
dynamic time warping (DTW) [2], derivative dynamic time warping (DDTW)
[3], iterative motion warping (IMW) [4] as baselines. in order to
align more than two sequences, we extended DTW, DDTW and IMW to pDTW,
pDDTW and pIMW resepctively by adopting the framework of Procrustes
analysis [5]. Most of the functions have been written and documented
in Matlab format. In order to achieve efficiency, we provided C++
implementations for some functions.

Installation
    1. unzip gtw.zip to your folder;
    2. Run make.m to compile all C++ files;
    3. Run addPath.m to add sub-directories into the path of Matlab.
    4. Run demoToy.m

Instructions
The package of gtw.zip contains following files:
    ./src: This folder contains the main implmentation of GTW and other baseline methods.
    ./lib: This folder contains some necessary library functions.
    ./make.m: Matlab makefile for C++ code.
    ./addPath.m: Adds the sub-directories into the path of Matlab.
    ./demoToy.m: Time alignment of three synthetic sequences by GTW and other baseline method. Same function used for replicating the first experiment in the paper [1].
